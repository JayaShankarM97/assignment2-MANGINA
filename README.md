## Chicken Ramen Nooodles
 **Chicken Ramen Noodles** are the best and i like them because of **instant cooking time**. I need not to wander over kitchen and mess up all the cooking stuff when i want to cook, as i can cook noodles in a few minutes. It gives me immense pleasure. Added ketchup is recommended.

## Time to write some **'CODE'**

> Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code (via LLVM). Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.

### KOTLIN LANGUAGE

Program to print an 'Integer' in 'Kotlin language'

```
import java.util.Scanner

fun main(args: Array<String>) {

    // Creates a reader instance which takes
    // input from standard input - keyboard
    val reader = Scanner(System.`in`)
    print("Enter a number: ")

    // nextInt() reads the next integer from the keyboard
    var integer:Int = reader.nextInt()

    // println() prints the following line to the output screen
    println("You entered: $integer")
}
```
