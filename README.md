## Chicken Ramen Nooodles
 **Chicken Ramen Noodles** are the best and i like them because of **instant cooking time**. I need not to wander over kitchen and mess up all the cooking stuff when i want to cook, as i can cook noodles in a few minutes. It gives me immense pleasure. Added ketchup is recommended.
